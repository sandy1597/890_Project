# Anomaly Detection and Forecasting of Time Series : A comparative study on LSTM and Xgboost
The goal of the project is to detect anomalies using LSTM and then use Xgboost, LSTM to forecast closing values of the apple stock data.

The Steps Used in this project are :
Pulling of Apple Stock Data Using Alpha Quandl API

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
---STL decomposition

Feature Engineering
---EMA,SMA,RSI, Bollinger Bands in Xgboost

LSTM model Development

Xgboost Model Development

EValuation of results
